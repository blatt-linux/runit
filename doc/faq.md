[]{#what}

### What\'s runit, why is it that different

What is this runit init scheme about? Why is it that different from sysvinit and
other init schemes?

Answer: Please see the [introduction](index.html), and web page about runit\'s
[benefits](benefits.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#help}

### I need some help with runit, what should I do

I have a question, runit is doing something wrong, or I\'m doing something
wrong, what should I do?

Answer: First see the documentation, especially this list of [frequently asked
questions](faq.html), and the man pages if you have a question about a specific
runit program. If that still doesn\'t answer your question, try to search the
[supervision mailing list
archive](http://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.supervision.general).
Finally, if this fails, feel free to post your question to the [supervision
mailing list](http://skarnet.org/lists/).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#license}

### What\'s the license, is runit free software

I would like to distribute runit, in source and binary form. Am I allowed to do
so?

Answer: runit is free software, it\'s licensed under a three-clause BSD alike
license. See the file package/COPYING in the runit tarball.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#run}

### How do I run a service under runit service supervision

I want a service to be run under runit service supervision, so that it\'s
automatically started on system boot, and supervised while system uptime. How
does that work?

Answer: runit doesn\'t use the usual /etc/init.d/ init script interface, but
uses a directory per service. To integrate a service into the runit init scheme,
[create a service directory](#create) for the service, and [tell runit](#tell)
about it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#create}

### How do I create a new service directory

How do I create a service directory for the use with runit?

Answer: Service directories usually are placed into the /etc/sv/ directory.
Create a new directory for your service in /etc/sv/, put a ./run script into it,
and make the script executable. Note that for the use with runit, [service
daemons](#service) must not put themself into the background, but must run in
the foreground. Here\'s a simple example for a getty service:

     $ cat /etc/sv/getty-2/run
     #!/bin/sh
     exec getty 38400 tty2 linux
     $ 

Note the exec in the last line, it tells the shell that interprets the script to
replace itself with the service daemon getty; this is necessary to make
[controlling the service](#control) work properly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#createlog}

### How do I create a new service directory with an appendant log service

How do I create a service directory with an appendant log service for the use
with runit?

Answer: First [create the service directory](#create) for the service. Then
create a subdirectory ./log in the service directory, again put a ./run script
into it, and make the script executable. The ./run script must run a service
logging daemon, normally this is the [svlogd](svlogd.8.html) program. See the
[runsv](runsv.8.html) man page for details. Here\'s an example of a ./log/run
script:

     $ cat /etc/sv/socklog-klog/log/run
     #!/bin/sh
     exec chpst -ulog svlogd -tt ./main
     $ 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#tell}

### How do I tell runit about a new service

I created a service directory for a service that should run under runit service
supervision. How do I tell runit about the new service directory, so that it
picks up and runs the service by default?

Answer: Create a symbolic link in /service/ pointing to the service directory,
runit will pick up the service within the next five seconds, and automatically
start it on system boot. E.g.:

     # ln -s /etc/sv/getty-2 /service/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#control}

### How do I start, stop, or restart a service

I want to stop a service temporarily, and probably restart is later, or I want
to have it restarted immediately. How can I control a service running under
runit service supervision?

Answer: Use the [sv](sv.8.html) program. E.g., to restart the socklog-unix
service, do:

     # sv restart socklog-unix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#signal}

### How can I send signals to a service daemon

I want to send a service daemon the HUP signal, to have it re-read its
configuration, or I want to send it the INT signal. How can a send signals to a
service daemon?

Answer: Use the [sv](sv.8.html) program. E.g., to send the dhcp service the HUP
signal, do:

     # sv hup dhcp

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#status}

### How can I query the status of a service

I want to now the status of a service, whether it is up and available, or down
as requested, or so. How can I find out this information?

Answer: User the [sv](sv.8.html) program. E.g., to query or check the status of
the socklog-unix service, do:

     # sv status socklog-unix

or

     # sv check socklog-unix

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#remove}

### How do I remove a service

I want to remove a service that currently runs under runit service supervision.
How do I tell runit?

Answer: Remove the symbolic link in /service/ pointing to the service directory,
runit recognizes the removed service within the next five seconds, then stops
the service, the optional log service, and finally the supervisor process. E.g.:

     # rm /service/getty-2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#depends}

### How do I make a service depend on another service

I have a service that needs another service to be available before it can start.
How can I tell runit about this dependency?

Answer: Make sure in the ./run script of the dependant service that the service
it depends on is available before the service daemon starts. The [sv](sv.8.html)
program can be used for that. E.g. the cron service wants the socklog-unix
system logging service to be available before starting the cron service daemon,
so no logs get lost:

     $ cat /etc/sv/cron/run
     #!/bin/sh
     sv start socklog-unix || exit 1
     exec cron -f
     $ 

See also the [documentation](dependencies.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#runlevels}

### What about runlevels

Other init schemes support runlevels, what about runit?

Answer: runit supports runlevels, even more flexible than traditional init
schemes. See [the documentation](runlevels.html).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#lsb}

### What about LSB init scripts compliance

I know about the [sv](sv.8.html) program to control a service, but have
applications that rely on the /etc/init.d/ scripts interface as defined through
LSB. Do I need to change the application to work with runit?

Answer: You don\'t need to change the application. The [sv](sv.8.html) program
supports the /etc/init.d/ script interface [as defined through
LSB](http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_2.1.0/LSB-generic/LSB-generic/iniscrptact.html).
To make this script interface work for a service, create a symbolic link in
/etc/init.d/, named as the service daemon, pointing to the [sv](sv.8.html)
program, e.g. for the cron service:

     # ln -s /bin/sv /etc/init.d/cron
     # /etc/init.d/cron restart
     ok: run: cron: (pid 5869) 0s
     # 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#user}

### Is it possible to allow a user other than root to control a service

Using the [sv](sv.8.html) program to control a service, or query its status
informations, only works as root. Is it possible to allow non-root users to
control a service too?

Answer: Yes, you simply need to adjust file system permissions for the
./supervise/ subdirectory in the service directory. E.g.: to allow the user
burdon to control the service dhcp, change to the dhcp service directory, and do

     # chmod 755 ./supervise
     # chown burdon ./supervise/ok ./supervise/control ./supervise/status

This works similarly with groups, of course.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#userservices}

### Does runit support user-specific services?

It\'s very nice to simply [create symbolic links](#tell) to add system-wide
services. Does this work for user-specific services too?

Answer: Yes. E.g.: to provide the user floyd with facility to manage services
through \~/service/, [create a service](#createlog) runsvdir-floyd with the
following run script and a usual log/run script, and [tell runit](#tell) about
the service

     #!/bin/sh
     exec 2>&1
     exec chpst -ufloyd runsvdir /home/floyd/service

Now floyd can create services on his own, and manage them through symbolic links
in \~/service/ to have them run under his user id.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]{#readonlyfs}

### Does runit work on a read-only filesystem

On my system /etc/ is mounted read-only by default. runit uses many files in
/etc/ it needs to write to, like /etc/runit/stopit, and the ./supervise/
subdirectories in the service directories. How can I make runit work on my
system?

Answer: Use symbolic links, runit deals with them well, even with dangling
symlinks. E.g., make a ramdisk available at a moint point, say /var/run/, and
create symbolic links for the files and directories that runit needs to write
access to pointing into /var/run/:

     # ln -s /var/run/runit.stopit /etc/runit/stopit
     # ln -s /var/run/sv.getty-2 /etc/sv/getty-2/supervise
