## Replacing sysvinit (GNU/Linux)

Follow these steps to migrate from *sysvinit* to *runit* on [Debian GNU/Linux
(woody)](http://www.debian.org/releases/woody/). The /sbin/init binary is not
replaced until step 6, *runit* is the default Unix process no 1 after step 7.

If you have installed the precompiled Debian package, start at step 3.

### Step 1: The three stages

*runit* looks for the three stages implementing the system\'s *booting*,
*running* and *shutdown* in /etc/runit/1, /etc/runit/2 and /etc/runit/3, create
the files now:

     # mkdir -p /etc/runit
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/debian/[123] /etc/runit/

Create also a getty service directory:

     # mkdir -p /etc/sv/getty-5
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/debian/getty-tty5/run /etc/sv/getty-5/
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/debian/getty-tty5/finish /etc/sv/getty-5/

If you want *runit* to handle the ctrl-alt-del keyboard request, do:

     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/debian/ctrlaltdel /etc/runit/

### Step 2: The runit programs

The *runit* programs must reside on the root partition, copy them to /sbin:

     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/command/runit* /sbin/

### Step 3: The getties

At least one getty must run in stage 2 so that you are able to login. Choose a
free tty, say tty5, where *sysvinit* is not running any getty (edit /etc/inittab
and kill -HUP 1 if needed), and tell [runsvdir](runsvdir.8.html) about the
getty-5 *service*:

     # mkdir -p /service
     # ln -s /etc/sv/getty-5 /service/

Start *runit*\'s stage 2 for testing:

     # /etc/runit/2 &

And check that the getty is running.

### Step 4: Reboot into runit for testing

Boot your system with *runit* for the first time. This does not change the
default boot behavior of your system, *lilo* will be told to use *runit* just
once:

-   reboot the system
-   enter the following on the lilo prompt:\
    init=/sbin/runit-init
-   watch the console output while *runit* boots up the system
-   switch to tty5 when stage 2 is reached, a getty should run there, you are
    able to login.

If you are not using *lilo* as boot loader, refer to the documentation of your
boot loader on how to pass init=/sbin/runit-init to the kernel.

### Step 5: Service migration

The goal is to migrate all services from *sysvinit* scheme to the *runit*
service supervision design; take a look at these [run scripts](runscripts.html)
for popular services. The migration can be done smoothly. For those services
that are not migrated to use run scripts yet, add the corresponding init-script
startup to /etc/runit/1, e.g.:

     #!/bin/sh
     # one time tasks

     /etc/init.d/kerneld start
     /etc/init.d/rmnologin

     touch /etc/runit/stopit
     chmod 0 /etc/runit/stopit

It is possible to just add /etc/init.d/rc 2 for having all services from the
former runlevel 2 started as one time tasks, but keep the goal above in mind,
supervising services has great advantages.

To migrate a service, [create a service directory](faq.html#create), disable the
service if it is running, disable the service in /etc/rc.conf or remove the
service startup from the /etc/rc.\* scripts and [tell runsvdir](faq.html#tell)
about the new service.

Repeat step 4 and 5, using **/sbin/runit-init 6** to reboot the system, until
you are satisfied with your services startup. If anything goes wrong, reboot the
system into the default *sysvinit* /sbin/init and repair the *runit* stages,
then start again at step 4.

### Step 6: Replace /sbin/init

Now it is time to replace the *sysvinit* /sbin/init binary:

     # mv /sbin/init /sbin/init.sysv
     # ln -s runit-init /sbin/init

### Step 7: Final reboot

The last step is to do the final reboot to boot the system with the new default
Unix process no 1 *runit*.

     # init 6

To report success:

     # ( uname -a ; cat /etc/runit/[123] ) |mail pape-runit-2.1.2@smarden.org

## Replacing init (\*BSD)

Follow these steps to migrate from *init* to *runit* on [OpenBSD
2.9](http://www.openbsd.org/) or [FreeBSD 4.4](http://www.freebsd.org/). The
/sbin/init binary is not replaced until step 4.

### Step 1: The three stages

*runit* looks for the three stages implementing the system\'s *booting*,
*running* and *shutdown* in /etc/runit/1, /etc/runit/2 and /etc/runit/3
respectively. Create the scripts now:

     # mkdir -p /etc/runit

    OpenBSD 2.9:
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/openbsd/[123] /etc/runit/

    FreeBSD 4.4:
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/freebsd/[123] /etc/runit/

Remove the svscanboot startup from /etc/rc.local by deleting the line `csh -cf
'/command/svscanboot &'` (this normally is the last one); *runit* will start
[runsvdir](runsvdir.8.html) in stage 2 after running rc.local in stage 1.

     # vi /etc/rc.local

### Step 2: The runit programs

The *runit* programs must reside on the root partition, install them into /sbin:

     # install -m0500 /package/admin/runit/command/runit* /sbin/

### Step 3: The getties

At least one getty must run in stage 2 so that you are able to login. To have it
run on the virtual console no 5, create the getty-5 service directory:

     # mkdir -p /etc/sv/getty-5

    OpenBSD 2.9:
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/openbsd/getty-ttyC4/run /etc/sv/getty-5/
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/openbsd/getty-ttyC4/finish /etc/sv/getty-5/

    FreeBSD 4.4:
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/freebsd/getty-ttyv4/run /etc/sv/getty-5/
     # cp -p /package/admin/runit/etc/freebsd/getty-ttyv4/finish /etc/sv/getty-5/

and tell [runsvdir](runsvdir.8.html) about the getty-5 *service*:

     # mkdir -p /service
     # ln -s /etc/sv/getty-5 /service/

Start *runit*\'s stage 2 for testing:

     # /etc/runit/2 &

And check that the getty is running.

### Step 4: Replace the /sbin/init binary

Before replacing the init binary, make sure that you are able to boot your
system alternatively, e.g. with a boot floppy, to restore the former /sbin/init
if anything goes wrong.

Make a backup copy of the current /sbin/init program and replace it with
/sbin/runit-init:

     # cp -p /sbin/init /sbin/init.bsd
     # install /sbin/runit-init /sbin/init

Boot your system with *runit* for the first time:

     # reboot

Watch the console output while *runit* boots up the system. Switch to the
virtual console 5 (CTRL-ALT-F5) when stage 2 is reached, a getty should run
there, you are able to login.

Use **init 6** to reboot and **init 0** to halt a system that runs *runit*. This
will cause *runit* to enter stage 3 which runs `/sbin/reboot` or `/sbin/halt` as
last command.

To report success:

     # ( uname -a ; cat /etc/runit/[123] ) |mail pape-runit-2.1.2@smarden.org

### Step 5: Service migration

The goal is to migrate all services from */etc/rc.\** scheme to the *runit*
service supervision design; take a look at these [run scripts](runscripts.html)
for popular services. The migration can be done smoothly. By default *runit*
runs the /etc/rc scripts in stage 1 as a one time task, so the services are
started automatically:

     #!/bin/sh
     # system one time tasks

     /bin/sh /etc/rc autoboot

     touch /etc/runit/stopit
     chmod 0 /etc/runit/stopit

To migrate a service, [create a service directory](faq.html#create), disable the
service if it is running, disable the service in /etc/rc.conf or remove the
service startup from the /etc/rc.\* scripts and [tell runsvdir](faq.html#tell)
about the new service.
