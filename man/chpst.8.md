# NAME

chpst - runs a program with a changed process state

# SYNOPSIS

`chpst [-vP012] [-u user] [-U user] [-b argv0] [-e dir] [-/ root] [-n inc]
[-l|-L lock] [-m bytes] [-d bytes] [-o n] [-p n] [-f bytes] [-c bytes] prog`

# DESCRIPTION

`prog` consists of one or more arguments.

`chpst` changes the process state according to the given options, and runs
`prog`.

# OPTIONS

`-u [:]user[:group]`

:   setuidgid. Set uid and gid to the `user`'s uid and gid, as found in
    `/etc/passwd`. If `user` is followed by a colon and a `group`, set the gid
    to `group`'s gid, as found in `/etc/group`, instead of `user`'s gid. If
    `group` consists of a colon-separated list of group names, `chpst` sets the
    group ids of all listed groups. If `user` is prefixed with a colon, the
    `user` and all `group` arguments are interpreted as uid and gids
    respectivly, and not looked up in the password or group file. All initial
    supplementary groups are removed.

`-U [:]user[:group]`

:   envuidgid. Set the environment variables `$UID` and `$GID` to the `user`'s
    uid and gid, as found in `/etc/passwd`. If `user` is followed by a colon and
    a `group`, set `$GID` to the `group`'s gid, as found in `/etc/group`,
    instead of `user`'s gid. If `user` is prefixed with a colon, the `user` and
    `group` arguments are interpreted as uid and gid respectivly, and not looked
    up in the password or group file.

`-b argv0`

:   argv0. Run `prog` with `argv0` as the 0th argument.

`-e dir`

:   envdir. Set various environment variables as specified by files in the
    directory `dir`: If `dir` contains a file named `k` whose first line is `v`,
    `chpst` removes the environment variable `k` if it exists, and then adds the
    environment variable `k` with the value `v`. The name `k` must not contain
    `=`. Spaces and tabs at the end of `v` are removed, and nulls in `v` are
    changed to newlines. If the file `k` is empty (0 bytes long), `chpst`
    removes the environment variable `k` if it exists, without adding a new
    variable.

`-/ root`

:   chroot. Change the root directory to `root` before starting `prog`.

`-C pwd`

:   chdir. Change the working directory to `pwd` before starting `prog`.  When
    combined with `-/`, the working directory is changed after the chroot.

`-n inc`

:   nice. Add `inc` to the `nice(2)` value before starting `prog`.  `inc` must
    be an integer, and may start with a minus or plus.

`-l lock`

:   lock. Open the file `lock` for writing, and obtain an exclusive lock on
    it. `lock` will be created if it does not exist. If `lock` is locked by
    another process, wait until a new lock can be obtained.

`-L lock`

:   The same as `-l`, but fail immediately if `lock` is locked by another
    process.

`-m bytes`

:   limit memory. Limit the data segment, stack segment, locked physical pages,
    and total of all segment per process to `bytes` bytes each.

`-d bytes`

:   limit data segment. Limit the data segment per process to `bytes` bytes.

`-o n`

:   limit open files. Limit the number of open file descriptors per process to
    `n`.

`-p n`

:   limit processes. Limit the number of processes per uid to `n`.

`-f bytes`

:   limit output size. Limit the output file size to `bytes` bytes.

`-c bytes`

:   limit core size. Limit the core file size to `bytes` bytes.

`-v`

:   verbose. Print verbose messages to standard error. This includes warnings
    about limits unsupported by the system.

`-P`

:   pgrphack. Run `prog` in a new process group.

`-0`

:   Close standard input before starting `prog`.

`-1`

:   Close standard output before starting `prog`.

`-2`

:   Close standard error before starting `prog`.

# EXIT CODES

`chpst` exits 100 when called with wrong options. It prints an error message and
exits 111 if it has trouble changing the process state.  Otherwise its exit code
is the same as that of `prog`.

# EMULATION

If `chpst` is called as `envdir`, `envuidgid`, `pgrphack`, `setlock`,
`setuidgid`, or `softlimit`, it emulates the functionality of these programs
from the daemontools package respectively.
