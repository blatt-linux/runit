# NAME

`sv` - control and manage services monitored by `runsv(8)`

# SYNOPSIS

`sv [-v] [-w sec] command services`

`/etc/init.d/service [-w sec] command`

# DESCRIPTION

The `sv` program reports the current status and controls the state of services
monitored by the `runsv(8)` supervisor.

`services` consists of one or more arguments, each argument naming a directory
`service` used by `runsv(8)`. If `service` doesn't start with a dot or slash and
doesn't end with a slash, it is searched in the default services directory
`/var/service/`, otherwise relative to the current directory.

`command` is one of up, down, status, once, pause, cont, hup, alarm, interrupt,
1, 2, term, kill, or exit, or start, stop, restart, shutdown, force-stop,
force-reload, force-restart, force-shutdown.

The `sv` program can be sym-linked to `/etc/init.d/` to provide an LSB init
script interface. The `service` to be controlled then is specified by the base
name of the "init script".

# COMMANDS

`status`

:   Report the current status of the service, and the appendant log service if
    available, to standard output.

`up`

:   If the service is not running, start it. If the service stops, restart it.

`down`

:   If the service is running, send it the `TERM` signal, and the `CONT`
    signal. If `./run` exits, start `./finish` if it exists. After it stops, do
    not restart service.

`once`

:   If the service is not running, start it. Do not restart it if it stops.

`pause cont hup alarm interrupt quit 1 2 term kill`

:   If the service is running, send it the `STOP`, `CONT`, `HUP`, `ALRM`, `INT`,
    `QUIT`, `USR1`, `USR2`, `TERM`, or `KILL` signal respectively.

`exit`

:   If the service is running, send it the `TERM` signal, and the `CONT`
    signal. Do not restart the service. If the service is down, and no log
    service exists, `runsv(8)` exits. If the service is down and a log service
    exists, `runsv(8)` closes the standard input of the log service and waits
    for it to terminate. If the log service is down, `runsv(8)` exits. This
    command is ignored if it is given to an appendant log service.

`sv` actually looks only at the first character of these `command`s.

## Commands compatible to LSB init script actions

`status`

:   Same as `status`.

`start`

:   Same as `up`, but wait up to 7 seconds for the command to take effect. Then
    report the status or timeout. If the script `./check` exists in the service
    directory, `sv` runs this script to check whether the service is up and
    available; it's considered to be available if `./check` exits with 0.

`stop`

:   Same as `down`, but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become
    down. Then report the status or timeout.

`reload`

:   Same as `hup`, and additionally report the status afterwards.

`restart`

:   Send the commands `term`, `cont`, and `up` to the service, and wait up to 7
    seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status or timeout. If
    the script `./check` exists in the service directory, `sv` runs this script
    to check whether the service is up and available again; it's considered to
    be available if `./check` exits with 0.

`shutdown`

:   Same as `exit`, but wait up to 7 seconds for the `runsv(8)` process to
    terminate. Then report the status or timeout.

`force-stop`

:   Same as `down`, but wait up to 7 seconds for the service to become
    down. Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the `kill`
    command.

`force-reload`

:   Send the service the `term` and `cont` commands, and wait up to 7 seconds
    for the service to restart. Then report the status, and on timeout send the
    service the `kill` command.

`force-restart`

:   Send the service the `term`, `cont` and `up` commands, and wait up to 7
    seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status, and on timeout
    send the service the `kill` command. If the script `./check` exists in the
    service directory, `sv` runs this script to check whether the service is up
    and available again; it\'s considered to be available if `./check` exits
    with 0.

`force-shutdown`

:   Same as `exit`, but wait up to 7 seconds for the `runsv(8)` process to
    terminate. Then report the status, and on timeout send the service the
    `kill` command.

`try-restart`

:   if the service is running, send it the `term` and `cont` commands, and wait
    up to 7 seconds for the service to restart. Then report the status or
    timeout.

## Additional Commands

`check`

:   Check for the service to be in the state that's been requested.  Wait up to
    7 seconds for the service to reach the requested state, then report the
    status or timeout. If the requested state of the service is `up`, and the
    script `./check` exists in the service directory, `sv` runs this script to
    check whether the service is up and running; it\'s considered to be up if
    `./check` exits with 0.

# OPTIONS

`-v`

:   If the `command` is up, down, term, once, cont, or exit, then wait up to 7
    seconds for the command to take effect. Then report the status or timeout.

`-w `sec``

:   Override the default timeout of 7 seconds with `sec` seconds. This option
    implies `-v`.

# ENVIRONMENT

`SVDIR`

:   The environment variable `$SVDIR` overrides the default services directory
    `/var/service/`.

`SVWAIT`

:   The environment variable `$SVWAIT` overrides the default 7 seconds to wait
    for a command to take effect. It is overridden by the `-w` option.

# EXIT CODES

`sv` exits 0, if the `command` was successfully sent to all `services`, and, if
it was told to wait, the `command` has taken effect to all services.

For each `service` that caused an error (e.g. the directory is not controlled by
a `runsv(8)` process, or `sv` timed out while waiting), `sv` increases the exit
code by one and exits non zero. The maximum is 99. `sv` exits 100 on error.

If `sv` is called with a base name other than `sv`: it exits 1 on timeout or
trouble sending the command; if the `command` is `status`, it exits 3 if the
service is down, and 4 if the status is unknown; it exits 2 on wrong usage, and
151 on error.
