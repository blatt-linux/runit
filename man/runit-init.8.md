# NAME

init - a UNIX process no 1

# SYNOPSIS

`init [ 0 | 6 ]`

# DESCRIPTION

`runit-init` is the first process the kernel starts. If `runit-init` is started
as process no 1, it runs and replaces itself with `runit(8)`.

If `runit-init` is started while the system is up, it must be either called as
`init 0` or `init 6:`

`init 0`

:   tells the Unix process no 1 to shutdown and halt the system. To signal
    `runit(8)` the system halt request, `runit-init` removes all permissions of
    the file `/etc/runit/reboot` (`chmod 0`), and sets the execute by owner
    permission of the file `/etc/runit/stopit` (`chmod 100`). Then a `CONT`
    signal is sent to `runit`(8).

`init 6`

:   tells the Unix process no 1 to shutdown and reboot the system. To signal
    `runit(8)` the system reboot request, `runit-init` sets the execute by owner
    permission of the files `/etc/runit/reboot` and `/etc/runit/stopit` (`chmod
    100`). Then a CONT signal is sent to `runit(8)`.

# EXIT CODES

`runit-init` returns 111 on error, 0 in all other cases.
