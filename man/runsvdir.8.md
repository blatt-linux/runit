# NAME

`runsvdir` - starts and monitors a collection of runsv(8) processes

# SYNOPSIS

`runsvdir [-P] dir [ log ]`

# DESCRIPTION

`dir` must be a directory. `log` is a space holder for a readproctitle log, and
must be at least seven characters long or absent.

`runsvdir` starts a `runsv(8)` process for each subdirectory, or symlink to a
directory, in the services directory `dir`, up to a limit of 1000
subdirectories, and restarts a `runsv(8)` process if it terminates. `runsvdir`
skips subdirectory names starting with dots.  `runsv(8)` must be in `runsvdir`'s
`PATH`.

At least every five seconds `runsvdir` checks whether the time of last
modification, the inode, or the device, of the services directory `dir` has
changed. If so, it re-scans the service directory, and if it sees a new
subdirectory, or new symlink to a directory, in `dir`, it starts a new
`runsv(8)` process; if `runsvdir` sees a subdirectory being removed that was
previously there, it sends the corresponding `runsv(8)` process a `TERM` signal,
stops monitoring this process, and so does not restart the `runsv(8)` process if
it exits.

If the `log` argument is given to `runsvdir`, all output to standard error is
redirected to this `log`, which is similar to the daemontools' `readproctitle`
log. To see the most recent error messages, use a process-listing tool such as
`ps(1)`. `runsvdir` writes a dot to the readproctitle log every 15 minutes so
that old error messages expire.

# OPTIONS

`-P`

:   use `setsid(2)` to run each `runsv(8)` process in a new session and separate
    process group.

# SIGNALS

If `runsvdir` receives a `TERM` signal, it exits with 0 immediately.

If `runsvdir` receives a `HUP` signal, it sends a `TERM` signal to each
`runsv(8)` process it is monitoring and then exits with 111.
